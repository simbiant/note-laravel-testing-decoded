# Contributing to Laravel Using TDD

## Open Source Community
There's a basic rule in the open source community: If your pull request does not include tests, then don't bother.
Offering companion tests for your contributions can help in a number of ways:
* What exactly does your code do? The tests will provide an example.
* A test offers immediate proof that your code works correctly, and does not break existing functionality.

## Branching
As a basic rule of thumb, it's a good idea to create a new Git branch for each bug fix or feature. Example:

```
git checkout -b feature/bookmarking
git checkout -b bug/messages-posted-twice
```

## Coding Guidelines
* PSR-4
